# Casino-Game
Simple Casino Game coded in C++

Hi !

A really long time I didn't post on GitHub, I was so much focused on my video game (Here : https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172950/TheCube/) that I didn't do anything else. But for now 1 month I am learning C++, and I am happy to show you my first video game ! I wanted to do a Casino Game, because it is also the first video game I have made in Python. It took me about 1 or 2 hours to make. I want to apologize for the code, because I wrote it in french. You can launch my game by compiled it, or I also uploaded the .exe file for people who don't have a compiler. I made it with Geany and I use iostream, random and ctime libraries. Don't hesitate to check my code and run it !

See you later !
Edouard
